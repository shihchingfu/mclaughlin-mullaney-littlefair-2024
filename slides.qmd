## Summary

- Use GP regression for classifying AGN light curves as containing flares or not.
- Synthetic light curves with injected flares
- ZTF light curves with injected and "real" flares
- Effects of observational cadence severely affects detection
- FPR are reasonable but retrieval is very low 
- Detected 17 AGN flare candidates from ZTF public data release

## Data

- AGN flares are rare.

- simulated dampted random walk
    - n = 10000, regular 10d cadence, uniform uncertainty of 0.1 mag

- ZTF Public Data Release 6 (August 2021)
- Optical r-band
- n = 9035 Type 1 AGN from SDSS DR7, ALPAKA catalogue

## Method


- Try on synthetic light curves and flares first
- Gaussian and Gamma flares
    - 1-2.5 mag, 100-1000 days, random location after day 300, but before 300d remaining
- subsample to ZTF cadence
    - will "remove" some flares
- Try on ZTF data with injected flares
- Try on ZTF data alone
- add outliers
    - 5 sd above the light curve sd

## GP fitting

- Celerite (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2017)
- Use Matern 3/2 kernel, assume a zero mean function?
- MCMC
    - 12,000 steps with 2,000 burn-n


## Results

## Comments

- "retrieval rate"
- nice story told by the figures
- supervised vs unsupervised learning
- no reasoning behind kernel choice
- would be nice to see more light curves
- Gaussian vs Gamma flare? why these?
- nicely structured experiments: good to see sampling cadence investigated
    - builds up from simple to more realistic
- cheating to inject synthetic flare into natural data
- good to see application of GPs not just interpolating poorly sampled data
- assume that entire flare is observed and not truncated
- extend to use multi-band analysis using GPs
- not clear what the points in figures represent, the "optimised" hyperparameter posterior
    - should show some uncertainties too
- would be interesting to see the "flow" of non-flares to flaring
- don't just connect the dots in a time-series with gaps
- subsampling might induce features, not just remove them
- no comment on the bimodal distribution of ZTF light curves
